The goal of this project is to create a model that can determine whether two images of artworks, representing creative tools used by different artists, were actually created by the same artist or not. The images serve as the dataset for training the model. Additionally, the images in the test set should come from artists who were not included in the training data. The objective is to develop an efficient model that can differentiate between images created by the same artist and those created by different artists, with the ultimate aim of applying this capability to the identification of artworks in the art world.
